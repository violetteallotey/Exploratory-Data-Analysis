# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Week 9 Project



# Report from analysis

### 1. All NaN values were dropped from the data
### 2. The data type for the Issue date was changed
### 3. The invalid data '99' in the Registration date was removed
### 4. Using a plot, the registration state with the highest number of summons was shown. It showed that NY state had the highest number of summons, followed by NJ then PR.
### 5. Moreover, a bar chart helped us to know the month that received the highest number of summons in NY state. The highest month was the ninth month. 
### 6. Also, with the other states, the bar chart helped to know the month that received the highest summons. It showed that the tenth month received highest summons. 
### 7. Lastly we saw that the code which was most violated was the violation code 36.

### From these analysis, I think the state can probe further to know why NY state received most summons.
### Also, with the months that depicted highest summons, a further research could be done to know the activities which goes on during that month that made people violate the packing rules.
### Lastly, knowing that the violation code 36 is the most violated, I think further research could be done to know why and probably educate the people or give some measures to prevent people from violating the code.
